Make developing with Bootstrap 5 even easier by using our free design system package (DSP) for Visual Studio Code. Gain direct access to Bootstrap code snippets and documentation with Intellisense right in the VS Code editor. This allows you to stay in flow and focus on development, instead of switching between your editor and the docs.

## Installing
To install Adobe Bootstrap DSP in your project, please run:

```
npm install @foxbox/adobe-bootstrap-dsp

## DSP Setup

- Install the [Adobe XD extension for VS Code](https://letsxd.com/vscode)
- Open the Adobe XD extension for VS Code (`Cmd+Opt+X` for Mac users) and select `Load package`.
- Navigate to your `node_modules` folder and load the `bootstrap-dsp` folder located inside `@foxbox/adobe-bootstrap-dsp` (DSPs contain a dsp.json file at the root level).
- Hit the `Start Editing` button
- Hit the `Finish Editing` button

With that a new build will be triggered and the `dist` folder will be updated

## Environment Setup

### HTML Webpage

- Change directory to `plainHTML-project`
- Open the `index.html` file in a browser

**Note:** refresh manually everytime you update the `index.html`

### Next/React Application

- Run `npm i` to install the dependencies
- Run `npm run dev`
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) on the browser
