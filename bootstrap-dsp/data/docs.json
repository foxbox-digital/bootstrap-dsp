Gain direct access to Bootstrap code snippets and documentation with Intellisense right in the VS Code editor. This allows you to stay in flow and focus on development, instead of switching between your editor and the docs.\n\nIt's built from the [XD-Bootstrap-v.5-UI-Kit](https://assets.adobe.com/public/4ed7617e-4c25-4294-6cc0-d240c39f8a7e) CC Library.\n\n## Languages\nBootstrap DSP supports code snippets for:\n- HTML\n- React\n\nWant more?
